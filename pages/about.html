                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p> I'm an engineer with a passion for precision and a curiosity that never rests. I'm always on the lookout
                        for my next project to challenge or inspire me. I strive for perfection and quality in everything I do.

                <h2>Whiskey</h2>
                <p> No portfolio is complete without acknowledging the real brains behind the operation, my cat Whiskey. 
                    She spends most of her days lounging in her catio, yelling for food, and being the most lovable menace
                    to society. Whenever I'm working on a project, she's always nearby, serving as my loyal, yet loud,
                    "professional" rubber duck.

                <h2>Workspace</h2>
                <p> I run with far too many monitors to keep my workflow efficient. Current PC specs are nothing special; 
                    however, I do use a custom-built Keebio Sinc split keyboard with Akko V3 Creamy Blues. The setup is 
                    always evolving to best serve my needs and interests.

                <p>
                    I seem to end up with more tools than sense. Organization boils down to what I can fit on the pegboard
                    and in Gridfinity organizers, drawers, and toolboxes. In my mind, as long as everything has a home, I can
                    be ready for whatever my next project throws at me.

                <h2>Music Gear</h2>
                <p>
                    I currently run a pair of KEF LSX speakers on my desk (yes, they're too far apart), and a pair of Sennheiser
                    HD 660s hooked up to a Schiit stack with a Modi 3+ and a Magni Heresy. For my "main" setup I run a pair of
                    Wharfedale Lintons powered by a Marantz NR1510.

                <p>
                    Right now, I use a Sony A7II with a Samyang 35-150mm f/2.8 lens. I also have a Rokinon 85mm 
                    f/1.5 and a Zeiss 24-70mm f/4. The lenses and camera body have wraps from ALPHAGVRD.
