                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p> An "infinity bottle" is a blend of spirits that evolves over time as it is
                        consumed and replenished. With each pour and addition it becomes a unique and personal
                        blend, a story of not just what you've drunk, but where you've been, what you've been through, 
                        and ultimately, who you are today. 
                    </p> </br>
                    <p> There are no strict rules for managing your infinity bottle, but generally,
                        it's filled with the last remaining ounces of liquour from a bottle.
                        It's reserved for special occassions, making sure the bottle is never emptied.
                        This way, even if the bottle sees use over the next hundred years a few
                        molecules from that very first addition will still be there.
                    </p> </br>
                    <p> I have two bottles that I started in 2023, a rum and a whiskey one. Both
                        are exceptional in their own right and I could never play favorites (it's
                        100% the rum bottle). These bottles are filled with memories, memories of those
                        who gifted me the bottles, memories of the places where I bought them, and memories of
                        enjoying them with people who matter most.
